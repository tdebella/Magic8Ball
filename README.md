#### Introduction
- Welcome to the Ask the Magic 8-Ball SkillBuilder!

- If you hit the Repl's Run button, you'll observe that the Senior Engineer has set up all the UI elements for this virtual magic 8-Ball. 
  Your task is to complete three functions in script.js that build upon eachother to implement the final user experience, which is...

- When the user types a question into the input box and clicks the 8-ball, it should display a random answer from one of three answer categories: 
  "positive", "negative", or "maybe". 
   If the user forgot to type a question, then the 8-ball should display a reminder instead of an answer: "You need to ask a question!".
